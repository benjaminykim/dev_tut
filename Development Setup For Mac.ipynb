    "### 3a. Download Zsh\n",
    "* To understand why you should download Zsh, you should first understand what a shell is and what bash is\n",
    "  * Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration. The keywords, syntax, dynamically scoped variables and other basic features of the language are all copied from sh. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)?oldformat=true)\n",

    "* Pimp your Zsh with [this](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh) framework. Inspect their readme for more information/utility\n",

    "\n",
    "### 3c. Configure Your Shell\n",
    "Most shells by default search for a configuration file in your home directory. \"RC\" stands for [run commands](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/rc-file.html). For instance:\n",
    "* BASH > .bashrc\n",
    "* ZSH > .zshrc\n",
    "\n",
    "So you'll need to create a file named .zshrc in your home directory in order to provide a start up script for your shell to run once you initiate your command line interpreter (CLI = terminal). However, in order to do so we need to know how to create a file, navigate your system, manipulate files/directories(folders), and execute commands all by using your CLI.\n",
    "\n",
    "That can take us down a long tangent that I'll get into in a later notebook. For now, download \n"
