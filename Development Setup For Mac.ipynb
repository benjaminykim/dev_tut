    "* To understand why you should download Zsh, you should first understand what a shell is and what bash is\n",
    "  >Bash is a command processor that typically runs in a text window where the user types commands that cause actions. Bash can also read and execute commands from a file, called a shell script. Like all Unix shells, it supports filename globbing (wildcard matching), piping, here documents, command substitution, variables, and control structures for condition-testing and iteration. The keywords, syntax, dynamically scoped variables and other basic features of the language are all copied from sh. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)?oldformat=true)\n",

    "* BASH > .bashrc\n",
    "* ZSH > .zshrc\n",
    "\n",
    "So you'll need to create a file named .zshrc in your home directory in order to provide a start up script for your shell to run once you initiate your command line interpreter (CLI = terminal). However, in order to do so we need to know how to create a file, navigate your system, manipulate files/directories(folders), and execute commands all by using your CLI.\n",

    "## 5. Terminal Multiplexer - TMUX\n",
    "### 5a. Introduction\n",
    "Install using `brew install tmux`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tmux allows users to have multiple 'little terminals' in one main terminal. Formally, it has:\n",
    ">1. Sessions - a process/unit that is running on a system. You can close tmux and have sessions continue to run in the background. This is great for remote installations, AI training, or processes that are time consuming.\n",
    "2. Windows - ideologically identical to a tab in your web browser. A session can have multiple windows and you can navigate between windows.\n",
    "3. Panes - a division in your window/session (your window is your session if you have no other windows open). Divide your window vertically/horizontally in order to help with your workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5b. Commands\n",
    "Tmux also has something special called a prefix key. This will precede any command specific to tmux. By default, it is `CTRL + B`. I don't like this prefix key and I remap it in my configuration file which is made available to you.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you wanted to split your window vertically in Tmux, you would hit `CTRL + B` + `\"`. To navigate between panes, you would use `<prefix> + o`. To split horizontally, `<prefix> + %`. To kill a pane, `<prefix> + x`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try it for yourself. Run `tmux` and try to split your window vertically. Here are [shortcuts](https://gist.github.com/MohamedAlaa/2961058) and a [guide](https://www.hamvocke.com/blog/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-tmux/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Run `exit` when you are done playing with tmux.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5c. Configure your Tmux\n",
    "I don't like some of the default commands in Tmux. So, I remmapped a bunch of them. I even changed the prefix key from `CTRL + B` to `CTRL + A`. This really only makes a difference if you change `CAPS LOCK` to `CTRL`, which I have done on my Mac (who uses `CAPS LOCK` these days anyway other than to yell at people on basketball forums?). I highly recommend remmapping your `CAPS LOCK` to `CTRL` as it will prove beneficial in VIM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyway, Tmux looks for a configuration file in your home directory. It is typically named `.tmux.conf`. If you were wondering what the `.` in front of a file name implies (think `.zshrc`), it suggests that the file is hidden and not available to users who do not know what they are doing. Since you know what you are doing, you can play with hidden files.\n",
    "\n",

    "* `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benjaminykim/dev_tut/master/.tmux.conf -o .tmux.conf -s`\n",

    "To see what instructions lie inside of this file, run the command `cat .tmux.conf` in order to peek inside. Read through the output of that command.\n",

Personally, I used Neovim, but Vim will do just fine. I have been using Vim for the last 4 years. I'll spend about 15 minutes a month learning/reinforcing a feature in Vim that improves my efficiency. I thought that the first 6 weeks using it were absolutely painful.
